# Forge Todo App - Custom UI

This project contains a Forge custom UI app written in React that displays in a Jira issue panel. 

See [developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge) for documentation and tutorials explaining Forge.

## Requirements

See [Set up Forge](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/forge/set-up-forge/) for instructions to get set up.

## Quick start

### Frontend
- Change into the frontend directory:
```
cd ./static/spa
```

- Install your frontend dependencies:
```
npm install
```

- Build your frontend by running:
```
npm run build
```

- Build and deploy your app from the top directory by running:
```
forge deploy
```

- Install your app in an Atlassian site by running:
```
forge install
```

### Notes
- Use the `forge deploy` command when you want to persist code changes.
- Use the `forge install` command when you want to install the app on a new site.
- Once the app is installed on a site, the site picks up the new app changes you deploy without needing to rerun the install command.
